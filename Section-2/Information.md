## 1. `nodemon`

### What is `nodemon`?

`nodemon` is a tool used in Node.js development. It automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever it detects changes in your code files. This saves you the hassle of manually stopping and restarting your server every time you make changes.

### Why use `nodemon`?

When you're developing a Node.js application, you often make frequent changes to your code. Without `nodemon`, you would need to stop the server (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal) and restart it manually to see the changes. `nodemon` automates this process, making development faster and more efficient.

### How to use `nodemon`?

1. First, install `nodemon` globally (so you can use it for any project) or locally (for a specific project).
   - To install globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g nodemon
     ```
   - To install locally (as a development dependency):
     ```bash
     npm install nodemon --save-dev
     ```
2. Once installed, instead of running your Node.js application with:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
   You can use:
   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```
   Now, whenever you save changes to your files, `nodemon` will automatically restart the server.

## 2. `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### What is this command?

This is a PowerShell command used on Windows systems. It changes the **execution policy** for the current user to allow running scripts, but only if they are signed by a trusted publisher.

### Why is this needed?

By default, Windows has strict security policies to prevent malicious scripts from running on your system. This can sometimes block you from running scripts (like those used in development tools, including `nodemon`). The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command loosens these restrictions for the current user, allowing you to run scripts safely.

### What does each part of the command mean?

- `Set-ExecutionPolicy`: This is the command to change the execution policy.
- `RemoteSigned`: This setting allows you to run scripts that you've written locally and scripts downloaded from the internet, but only if they are signed by a trusted publisher.
- `-Scope CurrentUser`: This ensures that the policy change applies only to the current user and not the entire system. This is safer because it limits the scope of the change.

### How to use this command?

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator (right-click on PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator").
2. Run the command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Confirm the change if prompted.

### Important Notes:

- Be cautious when changing execution policies, as it can expose your system to security risks if not done carefully.
- This command is specific to Windows and PowerShell. If you're using macOS, Linux, or another terminal, you won't need this.

### Summary

- **`nodemon`**: A tool to automatically restart your Node.js server when you make changes to your code.
- **`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`**: A PowerShell command to allow running scripts on Windows safely.

If you're just starting out, focus on understanding `nodemon` first, as it's directly related to Node.js development. The PowerShell command is more of a one-time setup for Windows users. Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸ˜Š
